# Corne ZMK config

This repository contains the ZMK config for my corne keyboard.

## Editing the keymap

The keymap is configured using the [keymap-editor](https://github.com/nickcoutsos/keymap-editor) web-gui.

## Rendered keymap

Down below is a rendered version of the my current keymap. The keymap is rendered from the ZMK keymap file using
the [keymap-drawer](https://github.com/caksoylar/keymap-drawer) workflow.
